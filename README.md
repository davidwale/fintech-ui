This is a UI for a Fintech Application User Dashboard.

### Setup


# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/davidwale/fintech-ui.git


# Install dependencies
npm install

## Getting Started


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Approach

Used NextJs and Tailwind for the project. The project includes sidebar and navbar to seamlessly navigate to different pages of the application. It is responsive on all screens. I used a mock API to call the data inside the application.
